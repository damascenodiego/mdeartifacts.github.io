# MDE Artifacts: Quality Guidelines for Research Artifacts in Model-Driven Engineering (Research Artifact)

The *MDE Artifacts* project constitutes a set of guidelines for artifact sharing specifically tailored to MDE research.

## Description

These guidelines are structured as a *list of factual questions* that cover quality concerns which
artifact authors, reviewers and Artifact Evaluation Committees (AEC) may ask about a research artifact.
For each factual question, we propose a list of research best practices that can be used to
address their respective factual questions (i.e., quality concerns).

## Repository layout

This project is organized as follows:

    artifacts/              # Associated artifacts 
        202107_models/          # The artifacts of the MODELS'21 paper 
    mkdocs/                 # The MkDocs project of the MDE Artifacts website
    docs/                   # The website auto-generated from the MkDocs project

Documentation of associated studies are available in the sub-folders of the [artifacts/](artifacts/) directory.
