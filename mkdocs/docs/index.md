# MDE Artifacts

The *MDE Artifacts* project introduces a set of guidelines for artifact sharing specifically tailored to MDE research.
These guidelines are structured as a *list of factual questions* that cover quality concerns which
artifact authors, reviewers and Artifact Evaluation Committees (AEC) may ask about a research artifact.
For each factual question, we also present a list of research best practices that can be used to
address those respective factual question (i.e., quality concerns).
