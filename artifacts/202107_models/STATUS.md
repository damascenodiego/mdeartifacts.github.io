Dear artifact reviewers and users,

We believe this artifact is according to the [ACM Review and Badging v1.1](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current) 
expectations for the badges:

- **Artifacts Available**: The authors must give the location of the artifact on a publicly accessible archival repository, along with a DOI or a permanent link to the repository. Submitting artifacts themselves through EasyChair without making them publicly accessible (through a repository or an archival service) will not be sufficient.
- **Artifacts Evaluated – Reusable** The emphasis lies on providing documentation on the research artifact previously prepared and archived. Here, the authors need to write and submit documentation explaining how to obtain the artifact package, how to unpack the artifact, how to get started, and how to use the artifact in more detail. The submission must only describe the technicalities of the artifact and uses of the artifact that are not already described in the paper.
