MDE Artifacts: Quality Guidelines for Research Artifacts in Model-Driven Engineering (Research Artifact)

This is directory contains the research artifact for the article 
_Quality Guidelines for Research Artifacts in Model-Driven Engineering_.
This article has been accepted the Foundations Track of the 
MODELS'21 conference as a Technical paper[^1].

#  What this artifact does?

In this artifact, you will find: 
(1) Text documents (in _.docx_ format) with the full set of research practices extracted; 
(2) Various mind maps (in _.mm_ format) that we created to categorize research practices according to the 5W2H framework;
(3) Our guidelines, which include the 19 factual questions and 84 best practices specifically tailored to MDE research projects;
(4) Our Survey results (Between April-May 2021) and R scripts for analyzing our responses and drawing plots.

# How to replicate the results of this work?

To reproduce this work, we recommend you look at the text documents and mind maps available in 
our [data/](data/) folder. 
There you will find the docx files and mind maps with the practices and understand
how we organized our study.

To support the analysis of the survey results, we also provide a set of RScripts and 
an RStudio project where the interested researcher can generate the plots 
for the participants' role, challenges faced by MDE experts,
overall satisfaction of our respondents,
and plots for the top-priority practices.

Below, we depict an overall structure of this artifact.

              04_guidelines_survey/     # Survey snapshot, and Anonymized results

## How to run the analysis of results?

To re-run our statistical analysis, 
please check our files **./analysis/analysis_0[1-4]*.Rmd**.
These files shall repeat our analysis and 
automatically generate most of the data we used to answer RQs 1 to 4.

## How could it be repurposed?

Currently, we find three ways this artifact could be repurposed:


1. This artifact can be adapted to particular types of MDE artifacts.
2. This artifact can be improved by incorporating different stakeholder's viewpoints
3. This artifact can be used to support researchers in designing domain-specific guidelines to their particular research fields.


# Requirements

For the running the survey, we recommend the [Google Forms platform](https://www.google.com/forms/about/).

For the running the statistical analysis, we recommend the following version of the R Statistical Package:


    **platform**:       x86_64-w64-mingw32          
    **arch**:           x86_64                      
    **os**:             mingw32                     
    **version.string**: R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31)

Also, we recommend using the RStudio IDE Version 1.4.1106

The hardware settings used in this study were:


    **OS Name**:	  Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 
    **Version**:	  10.0.19042 Build 19042 
    **System Type**:  x64-based PC 
    **Processor**:	  Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10510U CPU @ 1.80GHz
