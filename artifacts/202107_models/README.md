# Introduction

MDE Artifacts: Quality Guidelines for Research Artifacts in Model-Driven Engineering (Research Artifact)

This is directory contains the research artifact for the article 
_Quality Guidelines for Research Artifacts in Model-Driven Engineering_.
This article has been accepted the Foundations Track of the 
MODELS'21 conference as a Technical paper[^1].

Below, we depict an overall structure of this artifact.

#  What this artifact does?

In this artifact, you will find: 
(1) Text documents (in _.docx_ format) with the full set of research practices extracted; 
(2) Various mind maps (in _.mm_ format) that we created to categorize research practices according to the 5W2H framework;
(3) Our guidelines, which include the 19 factual questions and 84 best practices specifically tailored to MDE research projects;
(4) Our Survey results (Between April-May 2021) and R scripts for analyzing our responses and drawing plots.
 

# Where it can be obtained?

## GitHub (main repository)

This artifact is hosted at the [damascenodiego/mdeartifacts.github.io](https://github.com/damascenodiego/mdeartifacts.github.io) repository.

## Zenodo
This repository is also archived on Zenodo that issued a DOI for our MoDELS'21 paper artifact:
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5109401.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5109401)

## GitHub fork (website hosting)

There is a fork of this same repository which we maintain **only for the purpose of hosting the MDE Artifacts website** 
at the URL [https://mdeartifacts.github.io/](https://mdeartifacts.github.io/).

# How to replicate the results of this work?

A successful replication/reproduction of our work entails the following:
(1) Curation of research practices common to a given research community;
(2) Classification of practices according to the 5w2h method;
(3) Refinement of practices (e.g., remove redundancy, addition of missing practices);
(4) Repeating the survey among experts in the research community and the analysis of responses. 
To design your own replication/reproduction, we recommend the interested reader to look at the files available in 
the [data/](data/) and [analysis/](analysis/) directories. 
There you will find the docx files and mind maps with the practices and understand
how we organized our study.

In the directory [data/](data/),
you will find the _.docx_ files and mind maps in _.mm_ format with the practices and see how those could be organized.
To open the mind maps in _.mm_ format, we recommend the [FreePlane Mind Mapping tool](https://www.freeplane.org/).

In the directory [analysis/](analysis/),
we also provide a set of [RScripts](https://www.r-project.org/) and an 
[RStudio project](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) for reproducing the plots shown in the paper, 
e.g., participants' role, challenges faced by MDE experts,
overall satisfaction of participants, top-priority practices.

## How to run the analysis of results?

To re-run our statistical analysis, 
please check our files **./analysis/analysis_0[1-4]*.Rmd**.
These files shall repeat our analysis and 
automatically generate most of the data we used to answer RQs 1 to 4.

## How could it be repurposed?

Currently, we find three ways this artifact could be repurposed:


1. This artifact can be adapted to particular types of MDE artifacts.
2. This artifact can be improved by incorporating different stakeholder's viewpoints
3. This artifact can be used to support researchers in designing domain-specific guidelines to their particular research fields.


# Requirements

For the running the survey, we recommend the [Google Forms platform](https://www.google.com/forms/about/).

For the running the statistical analysis, we recommend the following version of the R Statistical Package:


    **platform**:       x86_64-w64-mingw32          
    **arch**:           x86_64                      
    **os**:             mingw32                     
    **version.string**: R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31)

Also, we recommend using the RStudio IDE Version 1.4.1106

The hardware settings used in this study were:


    **OS Name**:	  Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 
    **Version**:	  10.0.19042 Build 19042 
    **System Type**:  x64-based PC 
    **Processor**:	  Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10510U CPU @ 1.80GHz
