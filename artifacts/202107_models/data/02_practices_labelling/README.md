# Practices labelling

In this directory, you will find two groups of files with the practices labelled.
These files include:

1. The initial mind map with our practices grouped in branches for their own original guidelines. 
   This has two versions: 
     - The original mind map was created using the [Freeplane tool](https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Home) 
       and is indicated by the **.mm** extension.
     - The **.pdf** version of the mind map.
2. The final mind map with practices associated with their own 5W2H labels. 
    - Again, there is one mind map in **.mm** format and its respective **.pdf** version
